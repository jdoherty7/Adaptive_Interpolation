## Adaptive_Interpolation
A pythonic method for determining an adaptive interpolant as well as evaluating said interpolant on its valid interval.

# Full_Adapt
Calls on all of the scripts below to run an adpative interpolation method.
The user can choose the interpolant being used, the nodes being used, the
maximum relative error allowed, the interval to interpolate on, the function
to approximate, and the order of the interpolant.

# adapt2
Runs the actual method. Returns the coefficients of the interpolant and the
ranges on which these coefficients are valid.

# approximator
A class that allows the coefficients and ranges in adapt2 to be utilized in
a practical way. Mainly, this allows a fairly quick evaluation of a large
array of numbers with said interpolant.

# generate_C
Creates a string that can be executed as C code in a later setup.
